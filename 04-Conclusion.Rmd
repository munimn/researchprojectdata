# Conclusion

We have investigated the correlation between race and median income using from the ACS 5 year dataset on counties in the United States. We also included statistics on education and marital status in our analysis and regressions. Our results clearly support the concept of a model minority in terms of the positive trend found between the percent Asian population and median income. Some of our other findings were vague or unexpected. From our regression models there is statistically significant positive correlation between percent black and percent Hispanic/Latino with median income. These findings don't align with our initial data visualization but suggest that a more complex model and investigation in the future may lead to different or more accurate findings.
